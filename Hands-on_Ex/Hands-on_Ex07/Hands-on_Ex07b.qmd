# **Overview**

Proportional symbol maps (also known as graduate symbol maps) are a class of maps that use the visual variable of size to represent differences in the magnitude of a discrete, abruptly changing phenomenon, e.g. counts of people. Like choropleth maps, you can create classed or unclassed versions of these maps. The classed ones are known as range-graded or graduated symbols, and the unclassed are called proportional symbols, where the area of the symbols are proportional to the values of the attribute being mapped. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create a proportional symbol map showing the number of wins by Singapore Pools’ outlets using an R package called **tmap**.

# **Getting Started**

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tmap, tidyverse)
```

# **Geospatial Data Wrangling**

## **The data**

The data set use for this hands-on exercise is called *SGPools_svy21*. The data is in csv file format.

Figure below shows the first 15 records of SGPools_svy21.csv. It consists of seven columns. The XCOORD and YCOORD columns are the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of SingPools outlets and branches. They are in [Singapore SVY21 Projected Coordinates System](https://www.sla.gov.sg/sirent/CoordinateSystems.aspx).

## **Data Import and Preparation**

The code chunk below uses *read_csv()* function of **readr** package to import *SGPools_svy21.csv* into R as a tibble data frame called *sgpools*.

```{r}
sgpools <- read_csv("data/aspatial/SGPools_svy21.csv")
```

```{r}
list(sgpools) 
```

## **Creating a sf data frame from an aspatial data frame**

The code chunk below converts sgpools data frame into a simple feature data frame by using *st_as_sf()* of **sf** packages.

```{r}
sgpools_sf <- st_as_sf(sgpools, 
                       coords = c("XCOORD", "YCOORD"),
                       crs= 3414)
```

Things to learn from the arguments above:

-   The *coords* argument requires you to provide the column name of the x-coordinates first then followed by the column name of the y-coordinates.

-   The *crs* argument required you to provide the coordinates system in epsg format. [EPSG: 3414](https://epsg.io/3414) is Singapore SVY21 Projected Coordinate System. You can search for other country’s epsg code by refering to [epsg.io](https://epsg.io/).

```{r}
list(sgpools_sf)
```

# **Drawing Proportional Symbol Map**

To create an interactive proportional symbol map in R, the view mode of tmap will be used.

The code churn below will turn on the interactive mode of tmap.

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
```

## **It all started with an interactive point symbol map**

The code chunks below are used to create an interactive point symbol map.

```{r}
tm_shape(sgpools_sf)+
tm_bubbles(col = "red",
           size = 1,
           border.col = "black",
           border.lwd = 1)
```

## **Lets make it proportional**

To draw a proportional symbol map, we need to assign a numerical variable to the size visual attribute. The code chunks below show that the variable *Gp1Gp2Winnings* is assigned to size visual attribute.

```{r}
tm_shape(sgpools_sf)+
tm_bubbles(col = "red",
           size = "Gp1Gp2 Winnings",
           border.col = "black",
           border.lwd = 1)
```

## **Lets give it a different colour**

The proportional symbol map can be further improved by using the colour visual attribute. In the code chunks below, *OUTLET_TYPE* variable is used as the colour attribute variable.

```{r}
tm_shape(sgpools_sf)+
tm_bubbles(col = "OUTLET TYPE", 
          size = "Gp1Gp2 Winnings",
          border.col = "black",
          border.lwd = 1)
```

## **I have a twin brothers :)**

An impressive and little-know feature of **tmap**’s view mode is that it also works with faceted plots. The argument *sync* in *tm_facets()* can be used in this case to produce multiple maps with synchronised zoom and pan settings.

```{r}
tm_shape(sgpools_sf) +
  tm_bubbles(col = "OUTLET TYPE", 
          size = "Gp1Gp2 Winnings",
          border.col = "black",
          border.lwd = 1) +
  tm_facets(by= "OUTLET TYPE",
            nrow = 1,
            sync = TRUE)
```

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
```
